The Diabetes Prediction Project focuses on leveraging machine learning to predict the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes based on various health symptoms. 

Here are the parameters for normal and diabetic individuals presented in points:

- Glucose (mg/dL):
  - Normal Range: 70 - 99 (fasting), < 140 (2-hour postprandial)
  - Diabetic Range: ≥ 126 (fasting), ≥ 200 (2-hour postprandial)

- Blood Pressure (mm Hg):
  - Normal Range: < 80 (diastolic)
  - Diabetic Range: ≥ 90 (diastolic)

- Skin Thickness (mm):
  - Normal Range: < 25
  - Diabetic Range: ≥ 25

- Insulin (μU/mL):
  - Normal Range: 2 - 25
  - Diabetic Range: > 25

- BMI (kg/m²):
  - Normal Range: 18.5 - 24.9
  - Diabetic Range: ≥ 25

- Diabetes Pedigree Function (DPF):
  - Normal Range: 0 - 0.5
  - Diabetic Range: > 0.5

- Age (years):
  - Normal Range: 18 - 39
  - Diabetic Range: 40+
